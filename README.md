# SpringBootSocialMedia / JPA Relations Demo

This is a small project I built while learning Spring Boot and JPA.  
The goal is to create multiple entities, connect them with different relationships, and practice how they work in a real application.

## What it includes
- One-to-One  
- One-to-Many / Many-to-One  
- Many-to-Many  
- Basic CRUD operations  
- H2 in-memory database for testing

## Why I made this
I wanted to get more comfortable with JPA mappings and understand how entities interact with each other. This project is just a learning exercise.
